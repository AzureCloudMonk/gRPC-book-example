# tools

This is just some quick tooling I made to document how I designed the protos and got the data.

It can totally be deleted once we have all our definitions & data in place.



```bash
npm i         # install dependencies
npm run data  # get all the data from th API
npm run proto # generate the gRPC protobuf that matches the API
```
